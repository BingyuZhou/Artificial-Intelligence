# Artificial-Intelligence
Project work of BerkeleyX - CS188x_1 online course

This is the edx course of Artificial Intelligence. It mainly consists four projects.

1. Search:

  Implementation of search algorithms: A*, uninformed search, deepth first search and breadth first search for the Pacman game.

2. Multiagent:

  Consider the adversary agents living with our controlled agent, like the ghosts in pacman game. Use expectimax and minmax algorithms to find the action of the controlled agent.

3. Reinforcement learning:

  In the environment where we don't know the transition function T and reward function, reinforcemnet learning is a way to rebuild the reward function and transition function through samples of action and observation. Value iteration and Q-learning are the main algorithms to solve it.
  
  This project aimes to learn the correct motion of a crawler through RL.

4. Tracking:

  Desing the Particle Filter algorithm to play the BustersGhost game.
