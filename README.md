# Artificial-Intelligence
Project work of BerkeleyX - CS188x_1 online course

This is the edx course of artificial intelligence. It mainly consists four projects.

Search

Implementation of search algorithms: A*, uninformed search, deepth first search and breadth first search.

Multiagent

Consider the adversary agents living with our controlled agent, like the ghosts in pacman game. Use expectimax and minmax algorithms
to find the action of the controlled agent.

Reinforcement learning

In the environment where we don't know the transition function T and reward function, reinforcemnet learning is a way to rebuild the
reward function and transition function through samples of action and observation. Value iteration and Q-learning are the main algorithms
to solve it.
